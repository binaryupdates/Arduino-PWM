# Arduino-PWM
<p>The PWM is cool technique and can be implemented in Arduino is several ways.</p>

<p>The question is where it can be used; Let me give you one example. We have seen very often to turn LED/Light, ON or OFF. But then what, if we don't want to turn either ON or OFF. Rather we want to control voltage so that we can control brightness of an LED/Light. With PWM we can control the Duty Cycle of an Period of Clock. Now what is Duty Cycle and Period.</p>

<p>Now Let's first understand Period of Clock (Tcycle). It is used to determine speed of our Microcontroller. This Clock is represented as Clock cycle, which is the amount of time between two pulses of an Oscillator. And then Duty cycle is an fraction of time in which signal or system is active.</p>
